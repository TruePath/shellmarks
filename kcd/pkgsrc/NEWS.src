NEWS: Summary of changes in kcd
===============================

Changes in Version %VERSION% from 7.14.0
(%RELDATE%)

	- Remove --enable-debug-memory from configure script.
	- Remove configure check and support for very old C++ compilers.
	- Fix compilation with recent GCC versions.
	- Fix ncurses header location in recent Linux distributions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 7.14.0 from 7.13.1
(Dec 5, 2007)

        - New stable release from 7.13.1 branch.  No other changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 7.13.1 from 7.13.0
(Oct 13, 2007)

	- Fix various configure problems and compilation warnings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 7.13.0 from 7.11.0
(Jun 16, 2007)

	- Fix compilation problem with later GCC 4.0.x, 4.1.
	  (With some changes from Andreas Bernauer.)

	- New configuration commands: MountDir and ClearMountDir.
	  The `MountDir' command supports directory scanning when kcd
	  is invoked.  This is suitable for removable drive mounting
	  points.

	  Ex: MountDir = "/mnt/cdrom", All

	  The above command treat `/mnt/cdrom' as a mounted directory.
	  `All' is the action taken for this directory.  Scanning
	  for subdirectories inside `/mnt/cdrom' is always performed
	  regardless whether you specify the search string in the command
	  line or not.

	  Other action supported:	Tree		Scan only when
							search string is
							not supplied.
					Skip		Skip scanning.

	- New configuration command: ShowNewDir
	  The `ShowNewDir' controls whether the new directory kcd changed to
	  is displayed on the screen.  Possible values: Yes, No, Multi
	  (means only displayed when multiple matches exist).  The default
	  behavior is Multi.

	  Example: with the default behavior for the "kcd sbin" is not
	  displaying the destination directory if only one directory matches
	  the string "sbin".  Setting `ShowNewDir' to `Yes' always displays 
	  the destination directory.

	- Symbolic links in SkipDir and MountDir are handled correctly.

	- Directories containing `..', such as those found in configuration
	  commands, are not reduced since it could produce error when
	  symlink is present in the path.

	- New `-M' option to disable MountDir scanning.

	- `-t' and `-tr' support relative path.

	- Correct error message produced by `-t' and `-tr' when cannot find
	  specified directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 7.11.0 from 7.9.0
(Jan 1, 2005)

	- New command line search mode via `/' and `//' special symbols:
	  Ex: kcd usr/bin	Search directory containing `bin' such
				that its immediate parent directory
				contains `usr'.  Matches `/usr/bin', and
				`/usr/sbin'.
	      kcd usr//bin	Search directory containing `bin' such
				that any of its parent directories
				contains `usr'.  Matches `/usr/bin',
				`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/sbin', and
				`/usr/local/sbin', `/usr/X11R6/bin', etc.
	  This feature is available when `regex' library is present in
	  the system.
	- Find mode supports `/' and `//' special symbols when the key
	  binding mode is not `vi'.
	- The `-b' option supports `/' and `//' special symbols.
	- Add option `--profiles' to display all configuration profiles.

	- Fix a small bug.  kcd fails to cycle through all matched directory 
	  if current directory is matched to the search string and

	  PC line graphic chars or simple '-', '+', '|' chars are used.
	- More strict test of .kcd.save.gz.  This prevents kcd from 
	  segmentation fault when reading file created by previous 
	  versions of kcd which was compiled with different 
	  sizeof(mode_t) (caused when upgrading libc 5 to glibc 2).
	- Better control on scroll bars - they are hidden if not needed.
	- Pan left/right of highlight that is wider than screen enabled
	  via `,' and `.' keys.
	- New configuration command - `ScrollBar' to enable scroll bar display.
	  By default, scroll bars are hidden.  This will be changed 
	  in later versions once a new version of ncurses is released.
	  ncurses 4.1 and earlier version have a bug that causes 
	  the vertical scroll bar to flicker heavily during scrolling.
	- Improved configure script - several C++ features are tested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 4.5.1
(Jul 23, 1997)

	- Remove various messages printed during directory scanning since they 
	  are intended only for debugging purpose.
	- Fix a segmentation fault when exiting kcd.
	- Program freezes when saved directory tree contains circular symbolic 
	  link fixed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 4.5.0 from 4.0.1
(Jul 22, 1997)

	- Support symbolic link.
	- Automate dependency checks in Makefile.  (A Perl script, autodep, is
	  provided at ftp://kcd.sourceforge.net/pub/kcd/infrastructure/ to 
	  rebuild them.)
	- Automate version number, release date and file sizes info in 
	  README, CHANGES, kcd-?.?.?.lsm, kcd.1 and kcdmain.cc during
	  packaging.
	- Improve configure and Makefile to support srcdir option.  Object
	  and output files are properly placed in the desired
	  directory.
	- `-' used to ignore error when installing man page.
	- Various hardcoded limits removed, such as max. configuration columns.
	- When unrecognized command is found in configuration file, kcd now
	  aborts immediately.
	- When the line that causes error in configuration is printed, any
	  control characters present will be shown as `.'.
	- Source files *.cpp renamed to *.cc.
	- Various fixes in comments in the header of *.h, *.cc.
	- New screen layout.
	- Detect window size and refuse to continue if window too small.
	- Works with all directory with special chars under bash-2.0.
	- Add scroll bars.
	- Highlighted directory is shown on the bottom bar.
	- Better Up/Down arrow key navigation.
	- Support symbolic link selection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 4.0.2 from 4.0.1
(Aug 5, 1997)
	- New configuration command - `GraphicChar' determining whether 
	  PC line graphic chars or simple '-', '+', '|' chars are used.
	- More strict test of .kcd.save.gz.  This prevents kcd from 
	  segmentation fault when reading file created by previous 
	  versions of kcd which was compiled with different 
	  sizeof(mode_t) (caused when upgrading libc 5 to glibc 2).
	- Bugs in PgUp, PgDn response fixed.
	- kcd is now compiled and linked using `g++' instead of `gcc'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 4.0.1
(Mar 14, 1997)

	- Compiles even when resizeterm is not found.  Window resize under
	  xterm/rxvt is disabled in this case.

	Improved configure script
	- Check for the present of local ncurses, zlib in ../lib before the
	  global one.
	- Separate library test and header test for ncurses and zlib.
	- Display error when --bindir, --exec-prefix option is specified.

	Makefile
	- `make clean' and `make distclean' now remove buffer.o
	- Add `config.h' to list of dependent file.

	New kcd options, --features and --helpinst

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 4.0.0
(Mar 7, 1997)

	- New style syntax in configuration file.  Spaces are allowed inside
	  commands but double quotes ("...") are required to enclose
	  directory names.
	  For example:
		(earlier versions)	SkipDir=/cdrom
		(new syntax)		SkipDir = "/cdrom"
	- kcd now understands ~ and ~username specified in configuration file.
	- User will have to press Enter if any error is found in configuration
	  file.
	- The line that causes error in configuration is printed.
	- Directory tree are sorted (case-insensitive) by default.
	- All error reports use mixed case for config name, for example,
	  `skipdir' now becomes `SkipDir'.
	- New configuration command - `ClearSkipDir', `ClearStartDir', 
	  `SortTree', `SpaceSelect', `StartDir', `CaseSensitiveSort',
	  `QuietSmartScan'.
	- kcd version number in the directory tree screen reflects the version
	  of kcd running - not the kcd that creates the directory tree
	  file.
	- New file format.  kcd is forced to rescan automatically at the first
	  run.  The new format is no longer HTML-based, so do NOT use
	  khyper (came with earlier versions of kcd) to view .kcd.save.gz
	- Directory scanning can be terminated (except at the moment kcd is
	  writing data file which is immediately after finish scanning
	  and before time spent is displayed) without losing earlier
	  saved data.
	- Configuration files are read when kcd displays directory tree and
	  changes directory as well (although the loading message is
	  not explicitly shown).
	- kcd automatically redraw the screen when the window is resized
	  (under xterm).  The new ncurses-4.0 library is required to
	  support this feature.
	- In find mode (directory tree view), PgUp and PgDn behave like up and
	  down arrows respectively.
	- The way comment is handled in configuration is read changed - `#' 
	  inside double quotes (such as SkipDir="...") are treated as part of
	  directory name, not as comment.
	- Use configure script (autoconf-2.12)
	- kcd.sh.init, kcd.csh.init are automatically configured to the
	  installing directory.
	- By default, kcd will be installed in
			/usr/local/bin
	  for all new installations and in
			/usr/bin
	  for upgrading from earlier versions.
	  However, this behavior can be overridden by
			configure --prefix=PREFIX
	  (where PREFIX is /usr if you want to install in /usr/bin).
	- New kcdmain options: -ias, -ics, -ifs to support installation in
	  directories other than /usr/bin .
	- Generated binary (`kcdmain') are not stripped - To strip the symbol
	  table, type
			make strip
	- Makefile:
		- -I$(includedir) (which is /usr/include) removed.
		- -L$(libdir) (which is /usr/lib) removed.
		- Dependent files are .h instead of .o .
		- Use install instead of cp.
		- Use configure.
		- New `strip', `clean' and `distclean' targets
	
	- Smart scan mode implemented - almost twice as fast as the original
	  (now called full scan) mode.  (49 secs VS 91 secs on my 
	  system, both are tested immediately after system reboot.)
	- New option `-rf' to force full scan mode - needed when you modify
		config (SortTree, ...).
	- File listing moved from README to FILELIST .

	- Makefile.userinst:
		- Program restructure.
		- Fix error message dir. name from kcd to $HOME/kcd-bin .
		- Change -e to -f since -e is nonstandard.
		- Use install program supplied by configure.
	- kcd.csh.userinit - change $HOME to $home .
	- Test with directories with odd names such as `$HOME', `<', etc.
	  Most works fine except single quotes `'' and ``'.  Others 
	  are shell dependent.  bash (version prior 2.0) may display 
	  directory containing `$' incorrectly at the prompt although 
	  the directory change by kcd succeed.
	- New `\' quoting support for configuration values inside "...".
	  The character following `\' is treat as ordinary character.
	  `\', `'', `"' and ``' must be quoted as `\\', `\'', `\"'
	  and `\`' respectively.   Directory name containing `?', `*', 
	  `{' and `}' must also be quoted (for future features).
	- If the number directories that matches to the name given in
	  the command line exceeds a specified number,  kcd displays
	  the whole list.
	- Pressing Backspace or Del when the search string is empty exit 
	  find mode in directory tree window.
	- Replace `~' with `$HOME' in Makefile.userinst2
	- Add a man page kcd.1  It is mostly similar to README with 
		- no `kcd Basics', `System Requirements', ... sections.
		- different description for shell alias/function options to 
		  fit standard man page format.
	- Current working directory is automatically added to the directory
	  tree window if it is not in the saved tree.  They are
	  shown with `[*]'.  The new directory is, however, not saved 
	  to the file.  As a result of this change, kcd no longer 
	  generates the
			`kcd: cannot find <A NAME="...">'
	  error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 3.1.0
(Jan 13, 1997)

	khyper removed from this package.
	Fix editbox.cpp, editbox.h file permissions (previously executable).
	In find mode, control keys are no longer added into the search
		string.
	kcdscr passes more than one parameter to kcdmain so that help message
		is shown when too many parameters are given.
	Use our own version of strncase(...) - more portable.
	Fix kcd.sh.userinit and kcd.csh.userinit, now path is correctly set
		to ~/kcd-bin instead of ~/kcd.
	Fix a bug when directory names contain chars in the 128..255 range.
	Directory scan time is displayed.
	New option `-rQ' and new configuration command `quietfullscan'. (*)

(*) = It is intended to use with new features (currently not implemented)
      found in kcd-4.0.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 3.0.1  (Contains kcdmain 3.0.1 and khyper 0.4.0)
(Dec 27, 1996)

	Fix a bug - now works with directory name containing `&'.  File 
		format ID is also changed to force kcd to rescan directory 
		automatically at the first run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 2.0.2  (Contains kcdmain 2.0.2 and khyper 0.3.0)
(Nov 24, 1996)

kcdmain and khyper executables are no longer included due to possible
conflict when user's ncurses library is compiled using a different version
of gcc (C++ bool variable type).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 2.0.0  (Contains kcdmain 2.0.0 and khyper 0.2.0)
(Oct 27, 1996)

For kcdmain (directory rescan):

	The format of .kcd.save.gz has been changed.  But kcdmain can detect
	this and rescan directory to generate a new one.

	You can now jump directly to the desired directory by the using the
	following syntax to invoke kcd:

			kcd <portion of directory name>


	New -ia, -ic and -if option, for 'kcd' alias or function installation.
	Use
			eval `kcdmain -ic`

	for C shell-style syntax or

			eval `kcdmain -ia`

	for shells that support alias or

			eval `kcdmain -if`

	for shells that support functions.


	More error checking.

	Directories without read or execute permission are marked with 
	[unreadable].

	The zlib version required is 0.95, not 1.0.95 mentioned in kcd 1.0.0 
	README file.


For khyper (directory tree display):

	Up and down arrow keys behavior change, now it moves the highlight
	bar to the link directly above or below the current one.

	Pressing F10 or ^C (Ctrl-C) now exits khyper.  The previously
	defined 'q' key also works but produce a warning.  All alphanumeric
	keys are reserved for text find feature in the future version.

	F8 now repaints screen.

	Status bar added and the F9 key is used to switch between status
	display.

	Screen flicker during scrolling and initial screen display is
	totally eliminated.

	Option "-l" (search for link text and jump directly) is implemented.

	Tested under xterm.

	Change various character attributes (for monochrome terminals and
	xterm).

	More error checking.

	The zlib version required is 0.95, not 1.0.95 mentioned in kcd 1.0.0 
	README file.


For khyper File Syntax:

	khyper now ignores all unrecognized tags and will not report error
	message.

	For syntax error in recognized tags, khyper reports a more detailed 
	message including line and a small fraction of file that cause the
	problem.

	<A HREF="...">...</A> used to load another document is now
	supported.

	<A NAME="..."> now supports a closing </A> (comply to HTML standard).
	The </A> is optional but highly recommended for compatibility with
	future versions of khyper.

	Nested <A HREF=...>, <A NAME="..."> in any combination is not
	allowed yet.

	HTML <P>, </P>, <PRE>...</PRE>, <OL>...</OL>, <UL>...</UL>, <LI>,
	<HR> and <!--....--> tags and the new &quot; escape are implemented.

	<TITLE>...</TITLE> used to show document title on the status bar.

	khyper understands <H?> and </H?> (? = 1,2,3,4,5,6) tags and add an 
	empty line.  There is no attempt to display text larger than normal 
	due to limitation of text mode program.

	" ' and ` inside <A HREF=...> and <A NAME=...> tags can be nested.
	For example, <A HREF=`echo "$HOME,`date`"`> is properly parsed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 1.0.0
(Sep 26, 1996)

	This is the first version.  It contains kcdmain 1.0.0 and 
	khyper 0.1.0.
