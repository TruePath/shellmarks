Title:          kcd - Kriang's Change Directory
Version:        %VERSION%
Entered-date:   %LSMDATE%
Description:    kcd allows user to change directory by using various methods:
		- By using cursor keys to navigate through the directory tree
		  screen
		- By searching in directory tree screen
		- By typing part of the directory name directly at the 
		  command line.

		Other features include:
		- Can be configured to filter out to some subdirectories, 
		  useful for cdrom and msdos partition mounting points
		- Can be configured to scan directory tree starting from some
		  specified directory inwards, for example, home directory.
		- If the number directories that matches to the name given in
		  the command line exceeds a specified number,  kcd displays
		  the whole list.
		- Faster directory rescan if old data file exists.  Only 
		  directories with newer modified/changed time are scanned.
		- Sorted directory tree listing.
		- Can be installed inside your home directory for users 
		  without root access.
		- Mouse supported.

		Shells supported: bash, tcsh, zsh, pdksh, ash
