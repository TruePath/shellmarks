To build RPM files, follow the steps below:

1 Log in as root.
2 Copy the kcd-?.?.?.tar.gz file into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
  (where ?.?.? should be replaced by actual version number)
3 Extract kcd-?.?.?.spec from the kcd-?.?.?.tar.gz and
  place it in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/
4 Run the commands
	cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	rpmbuild -ba kcd-?.?.?.spec
  Generated RPM files are in /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/ and
  /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/

Note:	The default spec file that shipped with kcd always has
	release number 1.  If you modify/patch kcd in some ways,
	make sure the release number and packager are modified 
	as well.
