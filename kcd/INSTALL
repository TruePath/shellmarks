Installation Guide for kcd
==========================

System requirement for kcd:
===========================
You have to install these software before process with kcd installation
procedure.

- ncurses 4.2 (or newer).
- zlib 1.0.4 (or newer).
- gcc and g++ version 3.0 or newer together with libstdc++.

If you don't have root access to install ncurses or zlib, just build the 
static library and put header files in ../include and libraries in
../lib relative to kcd source files.  For example if kcd source directory 
is ~/tmp/kcd-x.y.z, put then in ~/tmp/include and ~/tmp/lib.
kcd will automatically recognize the files and use them instead of the
global ones.

If you are installing ncurses to shared location, you must use the 
option `--with-shared' in ncurses `configure' command.


kcd Installation Procedure:
===========================

Decide whether you want to install kcd for every user in your system
(which will be referred to as `system-wide' installation) or only for
your account only (will be refereed to as `user-specific'
installation).   The latter is useful if you do not have root access.


kcd Installation Procedure:
===========================

By default kcd will be installed in
 - `/usr/bin'		if former kcd installation was in /usr/bin
 - `/usr/local/bin'	otherwise

Type `./configure' (do not type the enclosing quotes) if you want 
to install kcd in the default directory shown above.  To override
the destination directory to `PREFIX/bin', add the `--prefix=PREFIX'
option to configure.  For example, if you want to install to
`/usr/bin', type `./configure --prefix=/usr'.

Note:  Avoid directory name containing space or special characters
as the destination directory.

There are several options that can be fine tuned for other directories.
Default values for these options may vary depending on whether the FHS
mode for directory structure is used.

 --sysconfdir=DIR	Directory for shared configuration file.

			Default value:
				/etc		Non-FHS, FHS

				/etc/PREFIX	FHS when PREFIX begins with
						/opt/...

			Note: If you do not have root access and have to
			install inside your home directory, you will have
			to set --sysconfdir to somewhere inside your home
			directory as well.

 --mandir=DIR		Base directory for man pages.  Man pages will be
			installed in MANDIR/man1.

			Default value:
				PREFIX/man	Non-FHS

				PREFIX/share/en_US/man	   FHS (depending
			     or PREFIX/share/en/man	   on which one
			     or PREFIX/share/man	   is present in
							   the system)


 --datadir=DIR		Base directory for translated messages.  Message
			files will be installed in directories inside 
			DATADIR/locale.

			Default value:
				PREFIX/share	Both FHS and non-FHS
Other configure options:

 --enable-wide-chars	Include wide char support.  This requires specially
			compiled version of ncurses.  Read the file UNICODE 
			for more information about this support.

 --disable-mouse	Disable mouse handling in kcd.

 --disable-nls		Do not use message translation.

 --disable-fhs		Do not install using directories introduced in FHS.
			FHS version 2.1 is used here.

 --with-static-ncurses	Link with static version of ncurses library.  It may
			be useful if you built a new version of ncurses
			library but forget to create the shared one.

 --with-included-gettext	Use included gettext functions instead of
				ones already installed in your system.
				Useful on platform without glibc.

 --with-catgets		Use catgets message system.  It's unlikely that 
			you'll need this option.

Create kcdmain executable by typing `make'.  If you have any error during 
compiling the program, refer to the Troubleshooting Section at the end of 
this file.

If you do not want to keep debugging information, type `make strip'.

Type `make install'.  make will automatically install the required 
executable files to PREFIX/bin.

If the directory `SYSCONFDIR/profile.d' exists, `kcd.sh.init' is
automatically copied to `SYSCONFDIR/profile.d/kcd.sh' and `kcd.csh.init'
to `SYSCONFDIR/profile.d/kcd.csh'.  Otherwise `kcd.sh.init' and 
`kcd.csh.init' are copied to `SYSCONFDIR'.

Note:  If you have not previously installed kcd, running the 'kcd-inst'
program (you may need to cd into the directory containing 'kcd-inst' first)
will add commands to your shell startup files, such as `~/.bashrc',
so that kcd becomes accessible.  You should also leave the string `For kcd' 
inside these files intact.  The string is used as a marker so that any 
future kcd installation will not touch these files again.


Creating kcd Configuration Files
================================

kcd uses its default parameters when no configuration files are found.
You can find more information about configuration commands in the README
file.  The following instructions are provided as an example to jump
start kcd.

If you want to skip some directories from being scanned and displayed, 
create `SYSCONF/kcd.conf' (that effects all users) or a private `.kcd.conf'
in your home directory (that effects only your account).   Following is a 
sample content of such file:

	SkipDir = "/mnt/cdrom"
	SkipDir = "/mnt/c"

Here subdirectories inside `/mnt/cdrom' and `/mnt/c' are not scanned and
stored.  Note that `/dev' and `/proc' are always treated as special
directories and are automatically skipped even when it is not specified
in `/etc/kcd.conf' or `.kcd.conf'.


Running kcd for the First Time
==============================

If you have not previously installed kcd, running `kcd-inst' program
will add commands to your shell startup files (such as `~/.bashrc')
so that kcd is accessible.  You should also leave the string `For kcd' 
inside these files intact.  The string is used as a marker so that any 
future kcd installation will recognize this.  If, in the future, you
decide to install newer kcd in a different directory, `kcd-inst' will
update commands in startup files to use the new directory instead.  

Logout and login again.  Type `kcd' at your prompt.  You should see now a 
graphical display of directory tree.   kcd may have to scan all directories 
(except the ones specified in the configuration) in your system before
displaying this screen.   Press F10 or Ctrl-C to exit.

If you want to rescan directory to reflect changes at any time later, just 
type `kcd -r' (normal mode) or `kcd -rq' (for quiet mode).


Troubleshooting
===============

- Compilation fails

	One common problem is that ncurses shared library is old compare to 
static library.  That because you forgot use the option `--with-shared' in 
ncurses `configure' command.  Follow the steps below to force kcd to be 
linked to static library.

	If `libncurses.a' is in either `/usr/local/lib' or `/usr/lib', 
	run configure with the option `--with-static-ncurses' added to 
	configure command.  Note that configure looks for libncurses.a in 
	/usr/local/lib before /usr/lib.

	Otherwise run configure with the option `--with-static-ncurses'
	and specify the directory name that contains libncurses.a as an 
	argument.  For example, when your ncurses static library is in 
	/mydir/lib, type

		./configure --with-static-ncurses=/mydir/lib

- During login, it cannot find one of the libraries used by kcd

	If you are using csh or tcsh, look for one of the following files:

		/etc/kcd.csh.init, /etc/profile.d/kcd.csh

	and modify this file to set the environment variable 
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the directory containing the libraries.

	If you are using other shells, look for one of the following files
	instead:

		/etc/kcd.sh.init, /etc/profile.d/kcd.sh

- When running kcd, it cannot find terminfo database or open the terminal

	If you are using csh or tcsh, look for one of the following files:

		/etc/kcd.csh.init, /etc/profile.d/kcd.csh

	and modify this file to set the environment variable 
	TERMINFO to the directory containing the terminfo database.

	If you are using other shells, look for one of the following files
	instead:

		/etc/kcd.sh.init, /etc/profile.d/kcd.sh
