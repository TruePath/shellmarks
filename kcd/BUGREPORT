BUGREPORT

When kcd displays error message containing

	kcd: Check the file BUGREPORT in the package for details

it means that it has detect some bug in the code.  You are encouraged to
file a bug report to either

	http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2516
or 
	lerdsuwa@users.sourceforge.net

The bug report should include the stack frame backtrace from the core file.
Follow the steps below for how to obtain one.  This requires that 
gdb (GNU debugger) is installed in your machine.

1. Look in the current directory that kcd fails.  There should be a file 
named `core'.  If it does not exists, either the current directory is not
writable or the core size limit is too small.  You can increase the
core size limit using the command `ulimit -c 100000'.

2. Locate the file `kcdmain'.  If you have already installed kcd in
/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin., it should be there.

3. Create a file, say `gdb.command', consisting of the following two lines

	bt
	quit

4. Suppose that your `kcdmain' is in /usr/local/bin, and `core' is in the
current directory (adjust the command line below otherwise), 
issue the following command

	gdb -x gdb.command /usr/local/bin/kcdmain core > backtrace

5. There should be the file `backtrace' in the current directory.
Copy and paste the file content into the bug report.  Don't forget to
include the version number of kcd that trigger the error message.
